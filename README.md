# Django library project

In this project I didn't focus much on visual aspects or full responsiveness of the website.
<br>
I wanted to make it functional, with backend database storing some information like books or users.<br>
In order to login and test feautures you can make a dummy account or use existing one.

## **Username** : test1, test7, test8 <br> **Password** : haslo123


Site has fully working admin panel. <br>
